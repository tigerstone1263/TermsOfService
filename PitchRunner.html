</p>

<p>TigerStone1263 enables access to certain premium features or content in exchange for one-time or recurring fees (each a "Paid Service"). The Paid Services include TigerStone1263 purchases, paid subscriptions, and other TigerStone1263 services.
</p>

<p>The Paid Services, and certain content available within the Paid Services, may only be available in certain countries.

</p>

<p>TigerStone1263 accepts payment via the payment method indicated prior to your purchase. You must have a valid, accepted payment method on file in order to purchase Paid Services. You agree to pay for any Paid Service that you order. TigerStone1263 will charge your payment method for the price listed for the relevant Paid Service along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, bank fees and currency fluctuations. If you purchase any automatically renewing Paid Service subscription, you agree that TigerStone1263 will charge the payment method on file on the first day of each billing period for the subscription, and if the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an expired credit card or other reason, and TigerStone1263 is unable to charge you on the next billing period, you may not be able to access the applicable Paid Service until you update your payment method. Where possible, we will provide you with notice when this happens. If you fail to update your payment method within a reasonable amount of time following that notice, TigerStone1263 may cancel your subscription. In some cases, you may transact with a third-party or affiliate platform when you purchase a Paid Service (e.g., if you subscribe to Pitch Runner Infinite Note using another platform like Apple or Google Play). In these cases, such platform will charge your payment method and be responsible for managing any issues with your payment, including refunds.
</p>

<p>If TigerStone1263 is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a Paid Service, such taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction.
</p>

<p>If you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that automatically renews with recurring payment, you may cancel the subscription any time before the end of the current billing period. Items, subscriptions, and services already purchased cannot be refunded unless there is a problem with the product.
</p>

<p>After completing a transaction or paying the applicable fees for a Paid Service, you may access and use that Paid Service, for your personal, non-commercial use only, and as long as you comply with the Terms and the law. Your license to the Paid Services (including any content offered through the Paid Services) is non-exclusive and all rights, title and interest in the Paid Services not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by TigerStone1263. You agree not to use any Paid Service, in whole or in part, in connection with any public presentation even if no fee is charged.
</p>

use the Paid Services in an illegal manner, or for an illegal purpose; share your TigerStone1263 account password with someone else to allow them to access any Paid Service they did not order; copy, sell, rent, or sublicense the Paid Services to any third party; circumvent, reverse engineer, modify, disable, or otherwise tamper with any security technology that TigerStone1263 uses to protect the Paid Services or encourage or help anyone else to do so; access the Paid Services other than by means authorized by TigerStone1263; or remove any proprietary notices or labels on Paid Services (for example watermarks).
</p>

<p>We’re constantly developing new features and ways to improve our services and we may modify the Service (including the Paid Services).
</p>

<p>The availability of content on a Paid Service may change from time to time, including when content within a Paid Service becomes limited or unavailable due to restrictions from our partners who license us that content, or for legal or policy reasons.
</p>

<p>Prices for Paid Services may change from time to time, for example, to reflect inflation, changes in pricing from our licensors, changes for promotional offerings, changes to the Paid Services or changing business needs.  TigerStone1263 does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering. Any changes to pricing for Paid Services with recurring payments will only apply following your consent. If we notify you of a price change for a Paid Service with a recurring payment and you do not consent to continuing that Paid Service at the new price, your subscription will not renew.
</p>

<p>TigerStone1263 will make sure to notify you of any suspension or modification of its Services. TigerStone1263 may have no other choice but to suspend its Services in part or in whole if there are any significant operational issues such as repair, inspection, replacement or disconnection of information communication facilities such as computers or servers. Meanwhile if there is a significant need for service operation or improvement, TigerStone1263 may change, modify or terminate Services in part or in whole.  If Services are changed, modified or terminated in whole or in part, TigerStone1263 shall not make any separate compensation unless there is a special provision in applicable laws.
</p>

<p>TigerStone1263 may modify these TigerStone1263 Terms of Service as well as account policies and posting operation policies from time to time, provided that such modifications will only be made to the extent they do not violate any applicable laws and TigerStone1263 will notify Members of reasons for such modifications and the effective date of such modifications within the Services in advance.  Moreover, in the event of material modifications of these TigerStone1263 Terms of Service that may put you at a disadvantage, TigerStone1263 shall make notifications of such modifications at least 30 days in advance within the applicable Services, and provide an individual notice to you through separate electronic means (e-mail, notification within the Services, etc.).
</p>

<p>TigerStone1263 waits for your comments on modifications from the date TigerStone1263 posts the modified terms and conditions until the effective date of such modifications.  If your comments are not received during the above time period, you will be deemed to have consented to using the Services pursuant to the modified terms and conditions.  Although TigerStone1263 is not happy about this, TigerStone1263 may not be able to provide applicable Services that are subject to the modified terms and conditions to you anymore if you do not consent to the modified terms and conditions.
</p>

<p>While these TigerStone1263 Terms of Service apply to TigerStone1263 Services by default, sometimes additional terms and conditions or operation policies other than these TigerStone1263 Terms of Service may additionally apply in order to reflect unique characteristics of individual Services.  Therefore, in the event of any conflict between the additional terms and conditions or account policies or posting operation policies and these Terms of Service regarding the provision of such individual Services, the additional terms and conditions and operation policies shall prevail.  Please check the details provided on the startup page of each individual Service.
</p>
